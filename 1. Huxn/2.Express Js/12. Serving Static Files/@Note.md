Let's break down each line of the code:

```js
const path = require("path");
```

- This line imports the `path` module, which is a core Node.js module. It helps to work with file and directory paths in a way that is independent of the operating system. For example, it can join paths, resolve absolute paths, etc.

```js
const express = require("express");
```

- This imports the `express` module, a web framework for Node.js. It simplifies routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests and responses. Express is commonly used to build web applications and APIs.

```js
const app = express();
```

- This line initializes an Express application. The `express()` function creates an app object, which you can use to define routes, middleware, and other configurations for your server.

```js
// app.use(express.static)
// express.static is a built-in middleware, which allows us to serve our static files.
```

- This is a comment explaining the purpose of `express.static`, which is the built-in middleware in Express that is used to serve static files like images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files. The comment is not actually code.

```js
app.use(express.static("1. Huxn/2.Express Js/12. Serving Static Files/public"));
```

- `app.use()` is used to apply middleware in the Express app. The `express.static()` middleware serves static files from the given directory.
- `"1. Huxn/2.Express Js/12. Serving Static Files/public"` is the relative path where static files (like images, CSS files, JavaScript files, etc.) are stored. Any file in this folder can be accessed directly by the browser.

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, "./public/index.html"));
});
```

- This defines a route handler for HTTP GET requests to the root URL (`/`).
- `req` represents the request object (the incoming HTTP request).
- `res` is the response object (the outgoing HTTP response).
- `res.sendFile()` sends the `index.html` file located in the `public` folder as the response. The `path.resolve()` function ensures that an absolute path is used to correctly locate the `index.html` file, regardless of the operating system.
- `__dirname` is a special variable in Node.js that holds the absolute path to the directory where the current JavaScript file is located.

```js
app.listen(5001, () => console.log("Listening on port 5001"));
```

- This starts the server and listens for incoming requests on port `5001`. When the server is up and running, it will log the message `"Listening on port 5001"` to the console.

### Summary:

- The code sets up an Express server.
- It serves static files from the `public` directory.
- It sends the `index.html` file as a response when the root URL (`/`) is accessed.
- The server listens for requests on port 5001.
