Sure! Here's a line-by-line breakdown of the code:

```javascript
import express from "express";
```

- This line imports the `express` module. `express` is a popular web framework for Node.js, which simplifies the creation of web servers and handling of HTTP requests and responses.

```javascript
const app = express();
```

- This creates an instance of an Express application and assigns it to the `app` variable. The `express()` function initializes a new Express app that will handle HTTP requests and responses.

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("welcome to express js");
});
```

- This line defines a route handler for HTTP `GET` requests to the root URL (`/`).
  - `app.get` is used to handle GET requests for the specified route (in this case, `/`).
  - `(req, res)` are the request and response objects. The `req` object contains information about the request, and the `res` object is used to send the response back to the client.
  - `res.send("welcome to express js")` sends the string `"welcome to express js"` as a response to the client when they access the root URL (`/`).

```javascript
app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log("server is running on port 5000...");
});
```

- This line tells the application to listen for incoming HTTP requests on port `5000`.
  - `app.listen(5000)` starts the server and makes it listen on port `5000` for incoming connections.
  - The callback function `() => { console.log("server is running on port 5000..."); }` is executed once the server starts, logging a message to the console indicating that the server is running.

### In summary:

- You import `express` and create an Express app.
- You define a route handler for the root URL (`/`) that responds with "welcome to express js" when accessed via a GET request.
- Finally, you start the server on port `5000` and log a message when the server is running.

This simple code sets up a basic Express server. When you visit `http://localhost:5000` in a browser or make a GET request to it, you will see the response: `"welcome to express js"`.
