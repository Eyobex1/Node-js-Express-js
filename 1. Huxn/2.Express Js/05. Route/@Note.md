Letâ€™s break down the code, line by line:

### Importing the `express` module:

```javascript
import express from "express";
```

- This line imports the `express` module, which is a popular web application framework for Node.js. The `express` object is used to handle routing, middleware, and more, to create a web server.

### Creating an Express application instance:

```javascript
const app = express();
```

- Here, the `express()` function is called to create an instance of the `app` object, which will be used to define routes, middleware, and start the server.

### Comment explaining what `app.route` does:

```javascript
// app.route returns a instance of a single route,
// which you can then use to handle HTTP verbs,
// with optional middleware.
// We use (app.route) to avoid duplicate code.
```

- This comment explains that `app.route()` is a method that allows you to chain multiple HTTP verb handlers (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for a specific route, which helps to avoid repeating code when defining the same route for multiple HTTP methods.

### Refactor section:

Here, the "Ugly Code" section (commented-out) contains repetitive code for different HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) for the `/student` route. Below, the code is refactored to avoid duplication by using `app.route()`.

#### Chaining route handlers:

```javascript
app
  .route("/student")
  .get((req, res) => res.send("All Students"))
  .post((req, res) => res.send("Add new Student"))
  .put((req, res) => res.send("Update Student"))
  .delete((req, res) => res.send("Remove Student"));
```

- **`app.route("/student")`**: This defines the route `/student` and allows chaining of HTTP method handlers.
- **`.get((req, res) => res.send("All Students"))`**: This handles `GET` requests to the `/student` route. When a `GET` request is made, the server responds with the text "All Students".

- **`.post((req, res) => res.send("Add new Student"))`**: This handles `POST` requests to the `/student` route. When a `POST` request is made, the server responds with the text "Add new Student".

- **`.put((req, res) => res.send("Update Student"))`**: This handles `PUT` requests to the `/student` route. When a `PUT` request is made, the server responds with the text "Update Student".

- **`.delete((req, res) => res.send("Remove Student"))`**: This handles `DELETE` requests to the `/student` route. When a `DELETE` request is made, the server responds with the text "Remove Student".

In summary, this chunk of code consolidates all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for the `/student` route into a single chain, avoiding redundancy.

### Starting the server:

```javascript
app.listen(5003, () => console.log("Server Up!"));
```

- **`app.listen(5003, ...)`**: This starts the Express server and makes it listen for incoming requests on port `5003`.
- **`console.log("Server Up!")`**: Once the server starts successfully, it logs "Server Up!" to the console, indicating that the server is now running and ready to handle requests.

### Summary:

- The code creates an Express server and defines a route (`/student`) that handles `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` HTTP methods using the `.route()` method. This approach reduces redundancy by chaining the different method handlers for the same route.
- The server listens on port `5003`, and once the server is up, it logs "Server Up!" to the console.
