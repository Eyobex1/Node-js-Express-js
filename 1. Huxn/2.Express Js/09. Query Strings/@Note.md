Here's a detailed explanation of each line of code:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
```

- This line imports the `express` module, which is a popular framework for building web applications and APIs in Node.js. `express` provides a set of tools and methods to simplify handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and more.

```javascript
const app = express();
```

- This creates an instance of an Express application by calling the `express()` function. `app` is now the main object you'll use to configure your server, handle requests, define routes, and so on.

```javascript
// A query string is the part of a URL that follows the question mark (?).
// It is used to pass data from the client to the server.
// The query string consists of one or more key-value pairs separated by ampersands (&), where each key is separated from its value by an equals sign (=).
```

- This is a comment explaining what a query string is. A query string is part of a URL that starts with a `?` and contains key-value pairs separated by `&`. For example, in the URL `example.com?category=electronics&id=123`, `category=electronics` and `id=123` are key-value pairs in the query string.

```javascript
// app.get("/product", (req, res) => {
//   console.log(req.query);
//   res.send(`Response Ok ${req.query.category}`);
// });
```

- This is a commented-out code block that defines a route for handling `GET` requests to `/product`. In this route:
  - `req.query` is used to access the query parameters from the URL.
  - `console.log(req.query)` logs the query parameters to the server console.
  - `res.send` sends a response to the client, including the `category` query parameter. The commented-out section was likely used for testing purposes.

```javascript
// Destructuring
// app.get("/product", (req, res) => {
//   const { category } = req.query;
//   res.send(`Product Category ${category}`);
// });
```

- This code is also commented out, but it's an example using **destructuring** (a JavaScript feature). It extracts the `category` value from `req.query` in a cleaner way and sends a response with that value. It makes the code more concise and readable by unpacking the `category` directly from `req.query`.

```javascript
// Multiple Query String
app.get("/product", (req, res) => {
  const { category, id } = req.query;
  res.send(`Product Category ${category} & Product ID: ${id}`);
});
```

- This is the active route handler that processes `GET` requests to `/product`:
  - It uses **destructuring** to pull out `category` and `id` from `req.query`.
  - It then sends a response that includes both the `category` and `id` query parameters, for example: `Product Category electronics & Product ID: 123`.

```javascript
app.listen(5003, () => console.log("Server Up!"));
```

- This line starts the Express server and makes it listen for incoming requests on port `5003`.
  - Once the server is up and running, it logs `"Server Up!"` to the console.

### In Summary:

- The code sets up an Express server that handles `GET` requests to the `/product` route, extracts query string parameters (`category` and `id`), and responds with those values.
- The server listens on port `5003`, and it logs "Server Up!" when it's successfully running.
