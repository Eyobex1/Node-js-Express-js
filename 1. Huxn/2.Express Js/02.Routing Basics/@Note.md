Here's a detailed explanation of each line of the code:

```javascript
import express from "express";
```

- This line imports the `express` module, which is a web application framework for Node.js. It helps simplify the creation and handling of HTTP servers and routing in a Node.js environment.

```javascript
const app = express();
```

- Here, an instance of the `express` application is created by calling `express()`. This instance (`app`) is used to define the routes and manage the server.

```javascript
// Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.
```

- This is a comment explaining what routing means: it’s the mechanism that determines how the server responds to different client requests based on the URL (endpoint) and HTTP method.

```javascript
// HTTP Methods
// GET👉 Retrive Data
// POST 👉 Create/Insert Data
// PUT 👉 Completely Update Data
// PATCH 👉 Partially Update Data
// DELETE 👉 Delete Data
// ALL 👉 Any HTTP Request Method
```

- This is a comment that explains the common HTTP methods:
  - `GET`: Used to retrieve data from the server.
  - `POST`: Used to send data to the server to create or insert new records.
  - `PUT`: Used to update an entire resource (replaces the entire data).
  - `PATCH`: Used to partially update a resource.
  - `DELETE`: Used to delete a resource.
  - `ALL`: A wildcard that matches any HTTP method.

```javascript
// BASIC ROUTES 👇
```

- This is a comment indicating the start of basic route definitions.

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("<h1>HOME 🏠 </h1>");
});
```

- This route listens for `GET` requests at the root URL (`/`). When the server receives a request to the root URL, it responds with an HTML heading `<h1>HOME 🏠</h1>`.

```javascript
app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
  res.send("<h1>ABOUT 😶‍🌫️ </h1>");
});
```

- This route listens for `GET` requests at `/about`. When the server receives a request to `/about`, it sends back the HTML heading `<h1>ABOUT 😶‍🌫️</h1>`.

```javascript
app.get("/contact", (req, res) => {
  res.send("<h1>CONTACT 📲 </h1>");
});
```

- This route listens for `GET` requests at `/contact`. When the server receives a request to `/contact`, it responds with the HTML heading `<h1>CONTACT 📲</h1>`.

```javascript
app.get("/work", (req, res) => {
  res.send("<h1>MY WORK 💪 </h1>");
});
```

- This route listens for `GET` requests at `/work`. When the server receives a request to `/work`, it sends back the HTML heading `<h1>MY WORK 💪</h1>`.

```javascript
app.listen(5000, () => console.log("Server Up!"));
```

- This line starts the server and listens for incoming HTTP requests on port `5000`. Once the server is up and running, it will log "Server Up!" to the console to confirm that the server is active and ready to handle requests.

### In summary:

- The code sets up an Express server with basic routes: `/`, `/about`, `/contact`, and `/work`.
- For each of these routes, it responds with simple HTML content.
- The server listens on port 5000 and prints a message to the console when it's running.
