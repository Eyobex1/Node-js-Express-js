Let's break down this code line by line:

### 1. Importing necessary modules

```javascript
import express from "express";
import student from "./routes/student.js";
import teacher from "./routes/teacher.js";
```

- **`import express from "express";`**: This imports the Express library. Express is a popular framework for building web applications in Node.js. The `express` object provides methods to handle HTTP requests and create server applications.
- **`import student from "./routes/student.js";`**: This imports the routes for the "student" section of the application, defined in a separate file `student.js` in the `routes` folder.
- **`import teacher from "./routes/teacher.js";`**: Similarly, this imports the routes for the "teacher" section from the `teacher.js` file.

### 2. Creating an Express app instance

```javascript
const app = express();
```

- This line initializes an instance of an Express application and stores it in the `app` variable. `app` is used to define routes, middleware, and other configurations for the application.

### 3. Comments explaining how the routing structure works

```javascript
// First check this link out ðŸ‘‡
// http://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#router
```

- This comment provides a link to the official Express documentation for routing. Itâ€™s intended to help users learn more about how routing works in Express.

### 4. More detailed comments explaining routing structure

```javascript
// 1. Create routes folder and put your routes in a separate file.
// 2. Create instance of express.Router()
// 3. Instead of app.method change that to "router.method"
// 4. Export router from a specific file
// 5. Import route in index.js file
// 6. use the (app.use) built-in middleware & provide your routes.
```

- These comments outline how to structure routes in separate files for better organization and maintainability. The process described is:
  1. Create a `routes` folder to store route files.
  2. Inside each route file, create an instance of `express.Router()` for defining routes.
  3. In route files, instead of using `app.method`, you use `router.method`.
  4. Export the `router` from the route file.
  5. Import those routers in the main `index.js` (or another entry point) file.
  6. Use `app.use` to register the routers for different URL paths.

### 5. Using middleware to handle routes

```javascript
app.use("/student", student); // All requests to /student will go to the student.js file.
app.use("/teacher", teacher); // All requests to /teacher will go to the teacher.js file.
```

- **`app.use("/student", student);`**: This line registers a middleware that listens for requests to the `/student` path. When a request is made to `/student`, it will delegate the handling of that request to the routes defined in `student.js`. In this case, `student` represents the imported route module.
- **`app.use("/teacher", teacher);`**: Similarly, this line registers the middleware for the `/teacher` path, which delegates requests to `teacher.js`.

These two lines ensure that any request made to `/student` or `/teacher` is handled by the appropriate route file, keeping the application organized.

### 6. Starting the server

```javascript
app.listen(5003, () => console.log("Server Up!"));
```

- **`app.listen(5003, () => console.log("Server Up!"));`**: This line tells the Express app to start a server on port `5003`. Once the server is successfully started, it will print "Server Up!" to the console. This means that your application is now running and listening for incoming requests on port 5003.

### Summary:

- The code creates a modular Express server where routes for "student" and "teacher" are handled in separate files (`student.js` and `teacher.js`), keeping the codebase organized.
- The `app.use()` function is used to attach route handling middleware to specific paths, ensuring that requests to `/student` and `/teacher` are routed to the corresponding route files.
- Finally, the server listens on port 5003 and prints a confirmation message when the server is up and running.
