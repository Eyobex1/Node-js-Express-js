Let's break down every line of the code:

```javascript
import express from "express";
```

- This line imports the `express` module, which is a popular web framework for Node.js that helps you build web applications and APIs. The `express` function is imported as the default export from the module and will be used to create the application instance.

```javascript
import products from "./products.js";
```

- This line imports data from a local file named `products.js`. It expects that `products.js` exports some data, which could be an array or object containing product information. The imported `products` will be used later in the API response.

```javascript
const app = express();
```

- This creates an instance of the Express application by calling the `express()` function. The `app` object now contains methods and properties to configure and handle routes and requests for the web server.

```javascript
// Install this extenction ðŸ‘‡
// https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa/related
```

- This is a comment. It provides a link to a Chrome extension called "JSON Formatter," which helps display JSON responses in a more readable and formatted way in your browser.

```javascript
app.get("/products", (req, res) => {
  res.json(products);
});
```

- This line sets up a route handler for GET requests to the `/products` endpoint.
  - `app.get("/products", ...)` tells the Express app to respond to HTTP GET requests that target the `/products` URL path.
  - The callback `(req, res)` is a function that will handle the request and the response.
    - `req` represents the incoming request (which contains information like query parameters, headers, etc.)
    - `res` is the response object that will be used to send the response back to the client.
  - `res.json(products)` sends the data stored in the `products` variable as a JSON response to the client. This would likely be an array or object containing product information, depending on how `products.js` is structured.

```javascript
app.listen(8000, () => console.log("Server Up!"));
```

- This line starts the Express server and listens on port 8000.
  - `app.listen(8000, ...)` tells Express to listen for incoming HTTP requests on port 8000.
  - Once the server starts, the callback function `() => console.log("Server Up!")` is executed, which logs the message "Server Up!" to the console to indicate that the server is running and ready to handle requests.

### Summary:

- The code sets up a simple Express web server that listens on port 8000.
- It includes an endpoint `/products` that responds to GET requests by sending back a JSON response containing product data from a file (`products.js`).
- The `json-formatter` extension link is provided to help format the JSON response in a more readable way during development.
