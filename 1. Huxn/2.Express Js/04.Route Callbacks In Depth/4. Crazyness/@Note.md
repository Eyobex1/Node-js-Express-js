Letâ€™s break down the code line by line:

### 1. Import Express

```javascript
import express from "express";
```

- **Purpose:** This line imports the `express` library, which is used to create a web server in Node.js. It allows you to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Explanation:** `express` is a popular web framework for building web applications and APIs. Here, the `express` function is imported to be used to create the app instance.

### 2. Create an Express Application

```javascript
const app = express();
```

- **Purpose:** This creates an Express application instance (`app`), which will be used to define routes, middleware, and start the server.
- **Explanation:** `app` is an object that will hold all the routes and configurations for your web server. It's the main interface for interacting with the Express framework.

### 3. Define the First Callback Function

```javascript
const cb1 = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("First callback");
  next();
};
```

- **Purpose:** This defines a middleware function `cb1` that will log a message and then call the `next()` function, which allows the request to move to the next middleware or route handler.
- **Explanation:**
  - `req` is the incoming request object.
  - `res` is the outgoing response object.
  - `next()` is a function that, when called, passes control to the next middleware in the stack.
  - The callback logs `"First callback"` to the console and then calls `next()`, passing control to the next function in the chain.

### 4. Define the Second Callback Function

```javascript
const cb2 = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Second callback");
  next();
};
```

- **Purpose:** Similar to `cb1`, this is another middleware function that logs a message and passes control to the next function.
- **Explanation:** It logs `"Second callback"` to the console and calls `next()` to move to the next middleware.

### 5. Define the Route with Middleware and Final Handler

```javascript
app.get(
  "/cbexample4",
  [cb1, cb2],
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("Third callback");
    next();
  },
  (req, res) => {
    console.log("Fourth callback");
    res.send("Combination of independent function and array of function");
  }
);
```

- **Purpose:** This defines a `GET` route at `/cbexample4` with multiple middleware functions and a final route handler.
- **Explanation:**
  1. **Route Path:** `"/cbexample4"` is the endpoint that users will access with a GET request.
  2. **Middleware (Array):** `[cb1, cb2]` is an array of functions that will be executed in order for this route:
     - The first function (`cb1`) logs `"First callback"`.
     - The second function (`cb2`) logs `"Second callback"`.
  3. **Third Callback:** The function `(req, res, next)` is another middleware function that logs `"Third callback"` and calls `next()`.
  4. **Final Route Handler:** The last function `(req, res)` is the final route handler that sends the response `"Combination of independent function and array of function"` after logging `"Fourth callback"`.

The execution order would be:

- `cb1` -> logs "First callback"
- `cb2` -> logs "Second callback"
- Third callback -> logs "Third callback"
- Final route handler -> logs "Fourth callback" and sends the response.

### 6. Start the Server

```javascript
app.listen(5003, () => console.log("Server Up!"));
```

- **Purpose:** This starts the Express server, listening on port `5003`. When the server is up and running, it logs `"Server Up!"` to the console.
- **Explanation:** The `app.listen()` function makes your app listen to incoming requests on port `5003`. When the server is successfully running, it logs a message indicating the server is up.

### Summary:

This code sets up a basic Express web server that:

- Handles a GET request at `/cbexample4`.
- Executes a series of callback functions (middleware) to process the request.
- Logs messages at each step of the process.
- Sends a response back to the client after logging the final message.

In this case, multiple callbacks (both as an array and individual functions) are used to demonstrate different ways to structure middleware.
