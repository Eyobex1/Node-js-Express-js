explaination of every line of the code:

```javascript
import express from "express";
```

- This imports the `express` module, which is a web framework for Node.js. `express` simplifies the process of building web servers and APIs.

```javascript
const app = express();
```

- Here, an instance of the Express application is created and assigned to the `app` variable. This `app` object will be used to define routes and handle HTTP requests.

```javascript
app.get(
  "/cbexample2",
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("First callback");
    next();
  },
  (req, res) => {
    res.send("More then one callback");
  }
);
```

- This is a **route handler** for GET requests to the path `/cbexample2`.

- The first argument is the route path: `"/cbexample2"`. This means that when a GET request is made to `/cbexample2`, the following callbacks will be executed.

- The second and third arguments are **middleware functions** (callbacks). These are executed in order when the route is hit:

  1. The first callback function `(req, res, next) => {...}` is the **first middleware**. It gets three parameters:

     - `req`: The request object (contains information about the incoming request, like query parameters, body, etc.).
     - `res`: The response object (used to send a response back to the client).
     - `next`: A function that must be called to pass control to the next middleware or route handler.
     - In this callback, `"First callback"` is logged to the console, and then `next()` is called to allow the next callback to execute.

  2. The second callback `(req, res) => {...}` is the **second middleware** or route handler. It sends a response to the client using `res.send("More then one callback")`.

- **Important Note:** `next()` is necessary to move on to the next callback. If you forget to call it, the request will hang, and the client won't receive a response.

```javascript
app.listen(3003, () => console.log("Server Up!"));
```

- This starts the Express server on port `3003`. When the server is up and running, it logs `"Server Up!"` to the console.

### Summary of what happens:

1. When a GET request is made to `/cbexample2`, the first callback logs `"First callback"` and calls `next()`.
2. The `next()` function causes the second callback to execute, which sends the response `"More than one callback"` back to the client.

### Key Points:

- **Multiple Callbacks**: You can chain multiple callback functions to handle a single route (this is called **middleware chaining**).
- **`next()`**: It's a function used to pass control to the next middleware function. Without it, the request wonâ€™t move to the next middleware.
