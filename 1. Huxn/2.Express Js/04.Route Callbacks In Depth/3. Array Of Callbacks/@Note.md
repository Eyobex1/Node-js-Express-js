Hereâ€™s an explanation of each line of code in the provided Node.js application using Express:

```javascript
import express from "express";
```

- This line imports the `express` module, which is a web framework for Node.js. Express simplifies the creation of web servers and APIs. The `import` syntax is part of ES6, so your environment should support it (e.g., using Babel or running in an environment that supports ES Modules).

```javascript
const app = express();
```

- This creates an instance of the Express application, allowing you to define routes, middleware, and other configurations for your server.

```javascript
// Array of callbacks
```

- This is just a comment indicating that the following code will define a set of callback functions (middleware) that will be used in the route handling.

```javascript
const cb1 = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("First callback");
  next();
};
```

- This defines the first callback `cb1`, which is a middleware function. Middleware functions in Express have access to the request (`req`), response (`res`), and the `next` function, which you can call to pass control to the next middleware or route handler in the stack.
- The callback logs "First callback" to the console.
- The `next()` function is called to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack (in this case, `cb2`).

```javascript
const cb2 = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Second callback");
  next();
};
```

- This defines the second callback `cb2`. It works similarly to `cb1`, logging "Second callback" and calling `next()` to continue the chain of middleware functions.

```javascript
const cb3 = (req, res) => {
  console.log("Third callback");
  res.send("Array of callbacks (response)");
};
```

- This defines the third callback `cb3`. Unlike the previous ones, this one sends a response to the client.
- It logs "Third callback" and sends a response with the text "Array of callbacks (response)" using `res.send()`, which ends the request-response cycle.

```javascript
// Passing array of callbacks
```

- This is another comment indicating that the next line will use the array of callbacks in a route definition.

```javascript
app.get("/cbexample3", [cb1, cb2, cb3]);
```

- This sets up a GET route for the path `/cbexample3` on the server. The second argument is an array of callback functions (`cb1`, `cb2`, `cb3`), which will be executed sequentially when this route is accessed.
- When a client sends a GET request to `/cbexample3`, the request will go through `cb1`, then `cb2`, and finally `cb3`. The response is sent from `cb3`, and no further middleware or route handlers will be executed after that.

```javascript
app.listen(5003, () => console.log("Server Up!"));
```

- This starts the Express server, listening on port 5003. When the server starts, it logs "Server Up!" to the console, indicating that the server is running and ready to handle requests.

---

### Summary of what happens:

1. When a GET request is made to `/cbexample3`, Express processes the array of callbacks `[cb1, cb2, cb3]`.
2. `cb1` logs "First callback" and calls `next()`, passing control to `cb2`.
3. `cb2` logs "Second callback" and calls `next()`, passing control to `cb3`.
4. `cb3` logs "Third callback" and sends the response "Array of callbacks (response)" to the client.
5. The server runs on port 5003, and when it's up, it logs "Server Up!" to the console.

This demonstrates how you can pass an array of callback functions in Express to handle a single route.
