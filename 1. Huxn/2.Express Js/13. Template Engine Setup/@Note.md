Let's go over the code step by step:

```javascript
import express from "express";
```

- **`import express from "express";`**
  - This imports the Express framework, which allows you to build web applications in Node.js. Express simplifies routing, middleware, and request handling.

```javascript
import web from "./routes/web.js";
```

- **`import web from "./routes/web.js";`**
  - This imports the `web.js` file from the `routes` directory. This file likely contains the routing logic and handlers for various HTTP requests that your application will respond to.

```javascript
import { join } from "path";
```

- **`import { join } from "path";`**
  - This imports the `join` function from Node.js's built-in `path` module. The `join()` function is used to concatenate multiple segments of a file path into a single valid file path, making it easier to work with file paths in a cross-platform way.

```javascript
const app = express();
```

- **`const app = express();`**
  - This initializes the Express application, allowing you to configure and handle routes, middleware, and other app settings.

```javascript
// 1. npm i ejs
```

- **`// 1. npm i ejs`**
  - This is a comment telling you to install the `ejs` package using npm (Node Package Manager). `ejs` is a templating engine that allows you to generate dynamic HTML pages using JavaScript. You would run `npm i ejs` in your project folder to install it.

```javascript
// 2. OPTIONAL:
app.set("views", "./1. Huxn/2.Express Js/13. Template Engine Setup/views");
```

- **`// 2. OPTIONAL:`**
  - This is a comment indicating that the next line is optional. If you donâ€™t specify the location of the views folder, Express will look for it in the default location (`views`).
- **`app.set("views", "./1. Huxn/2.Express Js/13. Template Engine Setup/views");`**
  - This tells Express where to find the EJS templates (views). The `views` directory is specified as `./1. Huxn/2.Express Js/13. Template Engine Setup/views`. This path may need to be adjusted based on where your files are stored.

```javascript
// 3. Tell your app that we're using "ejs" template engine.
app.set("view engine", "ejs");
```

- **`app.set("view engine", "ejs");`**
  - This tells Express to use EJS as the templating engine. It enables you to render EJS templates in your routes with `res.render()`, which will dynamically generate HTML from the EJS templates.

```javascript
// 4. Static Files
app.use(express.static(join(process.cwd(), "public")));
```

- **`// 4. Static Files`**
  - This comment indicates that the following line configures the app to serve static files (like images, CSS, and JavaScript files).
- **`app.use(express.static(join(process.cwd(), "public")));`**
  - This tells Express to serve static files from a directory called `public`.
  - `express.static()` is middleware that serves static files from a directory. Here, `join(process.cwd(), "public")` constructs an absolute path to the `public` directory, using `process.cwd()` (which gives the current working directory) and joining it with `"public"`.
  - Files in the `public` directory will be accessible at the root of your application. For example, a file located at `public/images/pic.jpg` can be accessed via `http://localhost:5005/images/pic.jpg`.

```javascript
app.use("/", web);
```

- **`app.use("/", web);`**
  - This tells Express to use the routes defined in the `web.js` file for handling requests to the root URL (`/`). The `web` module likely contains route handlers, which will process requests to various paths.

```javascript
app.listen(5005, () => console.log("Server Up!"));
```

- **`app.listen(5005, () => console.log("Server Up!"));`**
  - This starts the Express server and listens on port 5005 for incoming HTTP requests. Once the server is up and running, it will log the message `"Server Up!"` to the console.

---

### In summary:

1. **`express`** is imported to create the app.
2. **`web.js`** is imported to handle routing.
3. **`path`** is used to create file paths (e.g., for serving static files).
4. **EJS** is set as the view engine, allowing dynamic rendering of HTML with templates.
5. The **`public`** folder is used to serve static assets (like images and stylesheets).
6. The server listens on **port 5005**.
