Let's break down each line of the code step-by-step:

### 1. Importing the `EventEmitter` class

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require("events");
```

- Here, we are importing the `EventEmitter` class from the built-in `events` module in Node.js. `EventEmitter` allows us to work with events and listeners.

### 2. Creating an instance of `EventEmitter`

```javascript
const customEmitter = new EventEmitter();
```

- We create an instance of the `EventEmitter` class by calling `new EventEmitter()`. This object (`customEmitter`) will allow us to register listeners for events and emit those events.

### 3. Registering the first event listener (`on` method)

```javascript
customEmitter.on("response", (name, id) => {
  console.log(`data recieved user ${name} with:${id}`);
});
```

- `.on()` is a method used to listen for events. Here, we are registering a listener that listens for an event called `"response"`.
- When the `"response"` event is emitted, it will call this callback function with two arguments: `name` and `id`.
- Inside the callback, we use `console.log` to output a message that includes the `name` and `id` values passed to the event.

### 4. Registering another event listener for the same event

```javascript
customEmitter.on("response", () => {
  console.log("some other logic here");
});
```

- This is another listener registered for the same `"response"` event.
- When the `"response"` event is emitted, this callback will run. It doesn't accept any parameters, and simply logs `"some other logic here"`.
- The order in which you register listeners matters. When the event is emitted, listeners will be called in the order they were registered.

### 5. Emitting the `"response"` event

```javascript
customEmitter.emit("response", "john", 34);
```

- `.emit()` is used to trigger or "emit" an event. Here, the event `"response"` is emitted.
- The values `"john"` and `34` are passed as arguments to the event. These values will be passed to all listeners of the `"response"` event.
- In the first listener, `"john"` and `34` will be logged as part of the message: `"data recieved user john with:34"`.
- The second listener will simply log `"some other logic here"` since it doesn't use the passed arguments.

### Summary:

- **`EventEmitter`**: Provides the ability to handle events in Node.js.
- **`.on()`**: Registers a listener for a specific event.
- **`.emit()`**: Emits an event, triggering all registered listeners for that event.
- The listeners are executed in the order they are registered.
- Arguments passed during `.emit()` will be passed to the callback functions.
