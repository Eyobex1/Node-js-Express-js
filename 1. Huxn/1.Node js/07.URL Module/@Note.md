In the code, we're using the `URL` class from the `url` module to parse a URL string and access different parts of it. Let's walk through what each log statement will output:

1. **`myURL.hash`**  
   This will log the fragment identifier of the URL (the part after `#`), which is:  
   `#hash`

2. **`myURL.host`**  
   This will log the full host (including port if present), which is:  
   `www.example.com:8080`

3. **`myURL.hostname`**  
   This will log just the hostname without the port, which is:  
   `www.example.com`

4. **`myURL.href`**  
   This will log the entire URL as a string, which is:  
   `https://www.example.com:8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash`

5. **`myURL.pathname`**  
   This will log the path part of the URL (from `/` onward), which is:  
   `/p/a/t/h`

6. **`myURL.port`**  
   This will log the port number if specified in the URL, which is:  
   `8080`

7. **`myURL.protocol`**  
   This will log the protocol (scheme) of the URL, which is:  
   `https:`

8. **`myURL.search`**  
   This will log the query string, which is:  
   `?query=string`

9. **`myURL.searchParams`**  
   This will log the `URLSearchParams` object for the query string, allowing for manipulation of query parameters.

10. **`myURL.toString()`**  
    This will return the full URL as a string, which is the same as `myURL.href`, so it will log:  
    `https://www.example.com:8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash`

11. **`myURL.toJSON()`**  
    This will return a string representation of the URL object, which will be the same as `myURL.href` as well:  
    `https://www.example.com:8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash`

So the outputs would be:

```js
#hash
www.example.com:8080
www.example.com
https://www.example.com:8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash
/p/a/t/h
8080
https:
?query=string
URLSearchParams { 'query' => 'string' }
https://www.example.com:8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash
https://www.example.com:8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash
```

This covers the basic structure and behavior of the `URL` object and how you can extract information from it!
