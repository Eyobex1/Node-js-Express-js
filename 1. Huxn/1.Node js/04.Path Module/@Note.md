This is great breakdown of some common methods from Node.js's `path` module. You're using it to manipulate file paths, which is a fundamental task in file system operations.

Here’s a quick summary of what each part does:

- **`basename`**: Extracts the file name from a path. You’re correctly displaying the file name and omitting the file extension in some cases.
- **`dirname`**: Returns the directory name of a given file path.
- **`extname`**: Returns the extension of the file (like `.js`, `.txt`).
- **`join`**: Combines multiple path segments into one, ensuring proper path formatting for different platforms.
- **`normalize`**: Resolves any redundant or inconsistent path separators (like multiple slashes).
- **`parse`**: Breaks down the full path into its components, like `root`, `dir`, `base`, `ext`, etc.
