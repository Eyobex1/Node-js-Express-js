In the code , the comment at the bottom refers to the internal structure of a Node.js module. When a file is executed in Node.js, it automatically wraps the code inside a function with the following signature:

```javascript
(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
  // Code goes here
})();
```

This is known as the _module wrapper_. Here’s what each argument refers to:

1. `exports`: An object that will be exported from the module, meaning you can attach properties to it to share data between files.
2. `require`: A function used to import other modules or libraries.
3. `module`: Contains the metadata about the current module. The `module.exports` object is the actual output of the module.
4. `__filename`: The absolute path to the current file.
5. `__dirname`: The directory path of the current file.

So, when you log `__dirname`, `__filename`, and `module`, you’ll get information about the file’s location and the module's metadata.

For example:

```javascript
console.log(__dirname); // Logs the directory of the current file
console.log(__filename); // Logs the full path of the current file
console.log(module); // Logs the module object with its metadata
```
