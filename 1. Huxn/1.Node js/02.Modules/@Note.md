This code example demonstrates how CommonJS modules work in Node.js. Each file is treated as a module, and when you use `require()`, you import specific values or functions from other modules. Here's a breakdown of what's happening in the code:

1. **Module Imports:**

   - `const { person1, person2, person3 } = require("./names");`: This imports specific exports from the `names.js` file.
   - `const { num1, num2, num3 } = require("./numbers");`: This imports specific number variables from the `numbers.js` file.
   - `const greetings = require("./greetings");`: This imports the `greetings` function from the `greetings.js` file.
   - `const calculate = require("./calculate");`: This imports the `calculate` function from the `calculate.js` file.

2. **Calling Functions and Logging Values:**

   - `greetings(person1);`: Calls the `greetings` function with `person1` as the argument, which likely prints a greeting message.
   - `console.log(person1);`, `console.log(person2);`, `console.log(person3);`: Logs the values of `person1`, `person2`, and `person3` to the console.
   - `console.log(num1);`, `console.log(num2);`, `console.log(num3);`: Logs the values of `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.
   - `calculate(num2, num3);`: Calls the `calculate` function with `num2` and `num3` as arguments.

3. **Commented-Out Code:**
   The commented-out sections are just alternative ways to call `greetings()` for each person and log their names, but they are essentially redundant since the same actions are already being performed earlier in the code.

### Some Observations:

- The structure of the code implies a modular system where different functionalities (like greetings, numbers, and calculations) are split across separate files.
- Using `require()` in this manner allows you to reuse and share code while keeping it isolated and encapsulated within each module.
