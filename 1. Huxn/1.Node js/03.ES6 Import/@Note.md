To break it down:

- `greet("Huxn");`: This calls the `greet` function from the `greet.js` file with `"Huxn"` as the argument.
- `console.log(p1, p2, p3);`: This logs the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the `peoples.js` file to the console.

Just make sure that:

- `greet.js` is properly exporting the `greet` function.
- `peoples.js` is properly exporting `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

For example, in `greet.js`:

```js
export default function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

And in `peoples.js`:

```js
export const p1 = "Alice";
export const p2 = "Bob";
export const p3 = "Charlie";
```
