the code demonstrates various file system operations in Node.js using the synchronous API from the `fs` module. Here's a quick summary of what each section does and how you might use it:

1. **Creating a Directory**:

   - You can create a directory using `fs.mkdirSync()`. If you want to create nested directories, use the `{ recursive: true }` option to ensure that all intermediate directories are created.

2. **Reading Directory Content**:

   - `fs.readdirSync()` will return an array of file names in the directory specified. You can loop through and print each file name.

3. **Removing a Directory**:

   - `fs.rmdirSync()` removes an empty directory. If the directory contains files or other directories, this method will throw an error.

4. **Creating & Writing to a File**:

   - `fs.writeFileSync()` creates a new file (or overwrites an existing one) and writes data into it.

5. **Reading a File**:

   - `fs.readFileSync()` reads the contents of a file synchronously, and you can specify the encoding (e.g., "utf-8").

6. **Appending Data to a File**:

   - `fs.appendFileSync()` adds new content to the end of a file without overwriting the existing content.

7. **Copying a File**:

   - `fs.copyFileSync()` copies the content of one file to another.

8. **Getting File Information**:
   - `fs.statSync()` provides detailed information about the file, like whether it's a file or a directory, its size, and timestamps (created, modified, accessed).

The code is trying to check whether the `info.txt` file is a directory or a file using `stats.isDirectory()` and `stats.isFile()`, which will return `false` for directories and `true` for files.
